GaliGo is a brand developed by 3D Aerospace, a young tech startup that I interned with for 6 months.

## Motivation

The purpose of this project, other than developing a functioning website for the company I worked with, was to test my coding skills in the context of a real company website.

## Technologies

### HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT

This project was built responsively with HTML, CSS, and JS in their purest form. The design was done by myself just like the actual business side of the brand was developed by me during my time with the company.

### FTP

As this was my first time working with web hosting that I did not own myself, it helped me get used to FTP in order to make quick modifications to the website when needed.

## Features

### Automatic Phone Screen Slider

At the very top of the page you will see a smartphone illustration that shows different screens of the GaliGo application. This element challenged my layout skills as well as my ability to appropriately work with absolute position and the z-index CSS property.

### Content Sliders

The page features two more dynamic content sliders under "Problems" and "Solutions", both of which follow a similar approach yet are designed differently.

## Project Status

Of course, this website is far from done and I might keep working on it as a freelancer after my internship ends. As a matter of fact, we needed to build this website in just a couple of days as we had an application deadline to meet with no website to show at the time, so this was the short-term solution that I could come up with.
